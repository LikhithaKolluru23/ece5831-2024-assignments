Rock-Paper-Scissors Model using Teachable Machine

Youtube Video link: [https://youtu.be/ase5lY-4ihI]
I have also uploaded three images of each class for testing
The assignment is divided as:

1. rock-paper-scissor-live.py:
   - Captures live video from a webcam and makes real-time predictions for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. rock-paper-scissor.py:
   - Loads and predicts the class of a single image passed as input using the command prompt and gives the class of the image and confidence score
3. teachable.ipynb:
   - Uses the same script as rock-paper-scissor.py but with helper functions
4. Keras_model.h5:
   - Downloaded pretrained model from teachable machine
5. labels.txt:
   - labels downloaded along with the model
